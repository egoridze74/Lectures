1. Adverbs and adverbials to make big/small comparisons
	"His jokes are **just that little bit** funnier whe he's feeling confident"
	"Funny slogans are **way** better than standard ones"
	
	We can also use **anything/nothing like/nowhere near + as + adjective + as** to describe very big differences.
	"That joke was **nowhere near as** funny **as** you thought it was".
	"He's nothing like as clever as his father".
2.  Some adverbs have a comparative form similar to adjectives.
	"She can think of puns **faster** than anyone I know". 
	
	Adverbs formed from adjectives (with a -ly ending) are formed with more or less.
	"She can think of puns **more quickly** than anyone I know". 
3. Use **prefer** to to talk about general preferences.
	"I prefer spoonerisms to puns".
	
	Use **'d prefer/'d sooner/'d rather + than** to talk about a specific or hypothetical preference.
	"I'd rather watch paint dry than listen to another of your jokes".
4. There are a number of idiomatic expressions we use to compare things:
	- X is not a patch on Y (Y is much better)
	- X can't hold a candle to Y(Yis much better)
	- X is nothing compared to Y (Yis much better) 
	- X is not (even) in the same league as Y (Y is much better)
	- X doesn't bear comparison with Y (Y is much better)
	- X is beyond comparison (Xis the best)
