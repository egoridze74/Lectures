## Relative clauses and similar structures
### Reduced relative clauses
Wa can often shorten a relative clause by removing the relative pronoun (e. g. who, which, that) and the verb "be", to leave an -ing form or a past participle.
- Active voice: This blog is for anybody ~~who is~~ **looking** for useful skills.
- Passive voice: I liked the suggestions ~~that were~~ **made** by the writer.

### Similar structures
The following structures after nouns often work like relative clauses:
- to-infinitives, usually with a meaning of **must** or **can**:
	There are a lot of ingredients to buy (= which we **must** buy)
	I have no time to think (when I **can** think)
- Prepositional phrases: an article **by** a famous writer (= an article which is/was by a famous writer)
- Adjectival phrases: an article **full** of ideas (= an article which is/was full of ideas)
